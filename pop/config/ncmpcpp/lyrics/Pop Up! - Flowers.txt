And Sarah thinks she's died here once before
She's crazy
A pop-up book of flowers from grade four
Are driving her insane

No one knows why
She's sad tonight
No one can help her find

Crying, crying, she couldn't afford the view
Crying, crying, these automatic flowers won't do

Another brick
Another window frame's the confusion
Her garden blooms but Sarah can't see straight
She's drinking herself blind

And no one knows why
She stares outside
No one can help her fight

Crying, crying she couldn't afford the view
Crying, crying, these automatic flowers won't do
These automatic flowers won't do

She never admitted, she never considered
That she always means better
She's wasting all our time

Crying, crying, she couldn't afford the view
Crying, crying, these automatic flowers won't do
These automatic flowers won't do
These automatic flowers, flowers won't do

Won't do, hi-eee
Won't do
Won't do
Won't do
Won't do
Won't do
Won't do
Won't do
Ah-eee
