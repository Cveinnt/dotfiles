I found you here right beside me
Saying all the things you’ve never done
There’s not much time and less to say
Oh please, just come away
You could be my lady
And we’ll walk the streets
For no reason maybe
Just till you see won’t be so lonely
When you’re with me you won’t ever be so lonely

She’s well-known to police
'Cause she looks like a riot
Always takes what she needs and leaves the rest behind
Oh this love would kill me
But I don’t think I mind
Blame it on the way
We don’t even care
We know we'll be alright, alright, yeah

We fall asleep in the morning light
Oh, and when we dream we just might
Find a way to make sense of everything we've seen tonight
You could be my lady
And we’ll walk the streets
For no reason maybe
Just till you see won’t be so lonely
When you’re with me you won’t ever be so lonely

She’s well-known to police
'Cause she looks like a riot
Always takes what she needs and leaves the rest behind
Oh this love would kill me
But I don’t think I mind
Blame it on the way
We don’t even care
We know we'll be alright, be alright, be alright, yeah
We'll be alright

Wake up, turn around
You’re my girl
If you stick with me
Then you won’t ever be so lonely

She’s well-known to police
'Cause she looks like a riot
Always takes what she needs and leaves the rest behind
Oh this love would kill me
But I don’t think I mind
Blame it on the way
We don’t even care
We know we'll be alright, alright, yeah
Alright, alright, alright
