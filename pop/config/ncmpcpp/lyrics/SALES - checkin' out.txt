Coming-up empty
I wanna get fired
(Not ungrateful
Ready to retire)
My life's waiting for me
Waiting for me outside
In my mazda miata, baby
I want to get fired

Have one, two, three better things to do
Than stand here all dry
You left me hanging out to dry

Coming up empty
I wanna get fired
I'm not ungrateful, baby, to anyone
I want to retire
My life's waiting for me
Waiting for me outside
The car's still running, running
And I'm waiting not to be hung out to dry
