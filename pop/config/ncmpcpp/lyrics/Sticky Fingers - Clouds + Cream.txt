Hey, throw down your knowledge in a noose
And I will hang of every word you say
You, you never saw or cared when I was scared but now I shine
How she is disguising and despising under my pressure
Hurts however
I think you'll be okay

Me, I live a sorted dream of clouds and cream and
Hey baby, love my way
You, you sit and stare into the air and watch me fly
Fill up a bottle to the brim and let me swim in its anger
Hey stranger, I think I'll be okay

[Chorus:]
Cause I don't want the bother, I only want my mumma
And I will kill you lover, yeah we was meant together
Until I get another, I'll always ask you woman
Why, why, why just won't you die

You call my feelings broken, I'll smash my head right open
Place your hands deeply within, and feel my everything
So come and jump on my friend, I'll make your misery end
Hi, hi, hi, now we're fine

It's cold and silent no one's crying, it was all show
We know I, am a magician, apparition, and an in between
And if you don't want to believe in anything okay, hey baby
I think we're in a dream
I think your being mean

[Chorus]

[Outro x4:]
Now I've got a gun and I'm not scared
