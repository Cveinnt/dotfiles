Forget, I'll do it sometime
I'm locked up on the button
Can't you do it sometime?
Pushed it in too far

Fine, electrify my, oh
Electrify my golden tooth
Can't look at your eyes
Without sparking some...

Electrify my heart
Electrify my heart

Surprise, I'm in the same time
Beneath the same sun (oh yeah)
Oh man you cut me to size (ow!)
My little buttercup (that hurt!)

Fine, electrify my
Electrify my golden tooth
Can't look at those eyes
Without sparking some...

Electrify my heart
Electrify my heart

Electrify my heart
Electrify my heart
