I know I should go,
but I want to stay here with you,
in this room, I can tell
you'll never be all mine

Never mine
Okay
Never mine
Okay
Never mine
Okay

(Philosophy is man's expression of curiosity about everything and his attempt to make sense of the world through his intellect)

I know you have to go,
but I want to keep you to myself,
like a dream, I can tell
you'll never be all mine

Never mine
Okay
Never mine
Okay
Never mine
Okay

(Thinking, of course, is a word used in many ways and is a very vague word for most people. However, I use the word thinking in a very precise way. By thinking, as distinct from feeling or emoting or sensing, I mean the manipulation of symbols - whether they be words, numbers, or other signs such as triangles, squares, circles, astrological signs, or whatever. These are symbols, although sometimes symbols are a little bit more concrete and less abstract than that.)
