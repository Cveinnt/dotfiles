I wanna be everything that I'm not
I wanna be rich, I wanna show off
Just a desperado with a sour twist
It will all come sweet on your lips
'Cause I'm in love so old
Put your flowers down, it's too cold
Fuck your romance, I wanna pretend
That Jenny Lee Lindberg is my girlfriend

With the sun on my back it's a nice day
I will never choose any other way
With the sun on my back it's a nice day
I will never choose any other way

I need to come up to see my friends
I need to come down to feeling the same
I know I ain't cool right now
I'm as high as a fool I'm outta sight yeah

'Cause I'm in love so old
Put your flowers down, it's too cold
Fuck your romance, I wanna pretend
That Jenny Lee Lindberg is my girlfriend

With the sun on my back it's a nice day
I will never choose any other way
With the sun on my back it's a nice day
I will never choose any other way

With the sun on my back it's a nice day
I will never choose any other way
With the sun on my back it's a nice, day
I will never choose any other, way
