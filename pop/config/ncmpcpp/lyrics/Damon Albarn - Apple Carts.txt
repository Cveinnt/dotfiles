Pour the apple carts up from silvery hill
Pour the apple carts up from silvery hill
Higher into heaven, revealed on the adult dome
Respond to great authority singing alleluia, alleluia

Love does reign in the kingdom of the broken heart
The black bird sings, the moon, it starts, war begins, dawns

Now burn the apple carts
They were meant to look great
Fire making to grow in the space
There beneath the stones recharge

From great austerity turning lovers tonight
Silver and white are disdained
In the kingdom of the broken heart
The black bird sings, the sun
It starts, war begins, dawns
