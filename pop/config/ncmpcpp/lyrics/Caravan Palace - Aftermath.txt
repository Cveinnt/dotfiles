I hope you got hit by the boogie
They keep it all under my bed
Our mouth goes in, got the money
Move it, move it all under my bed

Oh, my pops used to say I'm a chumpy
They keep it all under my bed
Them girls and I can't fight it
And it's something I can put in my bed

I hope you got hit by the boogie
But that was justified by the pay
Our mouth goes in, got the money
Move it, move it all under my bed

I really hope you got hit by the boogie
That'd be the fee of my pay
Then it gets funny, do you feel me?
And it's, and it's something, and it's, and it's

I hope you got hit by the boogie
They keep it all under my bed
Our mouth goes in, got the money
Move it, move it all under my bed

Oh, my pops used to say I'm a chumpy
They keep it all under my bed
Them girls and I can't fight it
And it's something I can put in my bed

I hope you got hit by the boogie
But that was justified by the pay
Our mouth goes in, got the money
Move it, move it all under my bed

I really hope you got hit by the boogie
That'd be the fee of my pay
Then it gets funny, do you feel me?
And it's, and it's something, and it's, and it's

Under my bed, under my bed, under my bed, under my bed
Under my bed, under my bed, under my bed
Under my bed, under my bed, under my bed, under my bed
Under my bed, under my bed, under my bed

Move it, move it all under my bed
Under my bed
And it's, and it's something, and it's, and it's
