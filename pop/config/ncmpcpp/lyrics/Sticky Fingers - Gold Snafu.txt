For some this is all a game
Don't take me just a fool
Won't you just stay the fuck out of my way
Faking smiles and acting all the cool

From the sidelines to the front wide
I still be saving up for them new shoes
All the while I'll be wishing it's alright
Cause my main man on the right plays it good

[Hook 1:]
I see the sunrise getting high
I wish I was next to you
So coming down it's alright
Stumble through your gold snafu

[Hook 2:]
Yeah, for the first time in my life
I seen them velvet skies
And all that hurt was froze in ecstasy
I teach you how to fly

Forever's overthrown
And everybody comes alive
It's as simple as it's sold
And sexy as a slippery water slide

[Hook 1 x2]

So coming down it's alright
Stumble through your gold snafu
